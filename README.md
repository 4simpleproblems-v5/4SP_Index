## The Rapid Evolution

From a simple joke page to a professional local platform in under a year.

### The Vision (March 13, 2025)
Founded to provide a basic soundboard for students. It was small, simple, and relied on external hosting.

### The Turning Point (August 2025 - V4)
Introduced the dashboard, widgets, and the "Panic Key." This version defined the modern aesthetic but faced blocking issues.

### The Rebuild (December 2025 - V5)
A complete rewrite focusing on **local security**. Version 5 DV is the culmination: unblockable and offline-capable.

## Project Brief

"The definitive summary of the 4simpleproblems project."

### Overview
4simpleproblems (4SP) is a student-made web platform designed for bored school days. It blends utilities, multimedia tools, and soundboards into a tool that feels fast, personal, and strictly non-corporate. What began as a joke page has evolved into a robust, dashboard-style platform with advanced local security features.

### Core Philosophy
- Feel personal, not "fake-professional."
- Zero external dependencies for the local version.
- Fast load times, hard to block.
- Provide entertainment without tracking.

### Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
- Firebase (Auth/Functions) for online tiers.
- Tailwind CSS via CDN.
- Client-side focus for maximum privacy.
